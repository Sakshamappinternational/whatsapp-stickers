Stickers for WhatsApp<p>

<b>How to install these WhatsApp stickers?</b><p> 
To install these WhatsApp stickers, you need a sticker app. I am an iPhone user and I use Sticker Maker Studio by Tamara Vardanyan. I am sure Android has similar apps, if not the same. Once the app is installed, you can open the file in the app and it will then export to itself. This could work differently if you use a different app (or OS) of course. Keep in mind that you cannot view stickers if you use an older phone and you cannot update to a more recent version of WhatsApp.<p>

If you have any questions about the stickers, please ask me on Twitter! That is probably the fastest way. My handle is @_TMRPS. You can contact me in Dutch, English or German.
