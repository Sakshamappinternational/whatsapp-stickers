Stickers for WhatsApp<p>
<p>
<b>How to install these WhatsApp stickers?</b><p> 
You need a sticker app for this. I am an iPhone user and I use Sticker Maker Studio by Tamara Vardanyan. Android probably has similar apps. Once the app is installed, you can open the file in the app and then in WhatsApp itself. However, this probably depends on whatever OS or app you use. Keep in mind that you cannot view stickers if you use an older phone and you cannot update to a more recent version of WhatsApp.<p>

If you have any questions about the stickers, please ask me on Twitter! That is probably the fastest way. My handle is @_TMRPS. You can contact me in Dutch, English or German.
